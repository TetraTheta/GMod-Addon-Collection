# Part of the 'NPC Auto GodMode' configuration. 'NPC Auto GodMode' will only be triggered on these NPCs.
# You can add a comment using '#'.
# '#' can be either the start of the line or the middle of the line. Any character after '#' will be ignored.
# Don't add 'npc_citizen' in here! Colonel Odessa Cubbage will be handled automatically.
# NPCs will only be set to 'god mode' if they are not hostile to the player. But if they become hostile to the player during midgame, you must attack them first to remove their god mode.
